# Avoid Flood in The City

## Intuition

we need to make later decision. First, we record rains days in hash table, then we record the dry days in a treeset, if we meet a rain day which is already filled before, we choose a dry day which is the most closet to that day but after it to dry that lake to avoid flood, if we can not find such dry day, then we return an empty array.

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] avoidFlood(int[] rains) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        TreeSet<Integer> zeros = new TreeSet<>();
        int[] res = new int[rains.length];

        for (int i = 0; i < rains.length; i++) {
            if (rains[i] == 0) {
                zeros.add(i);
            } else {
                if (map.containsKey(rains[i])) { // find the location of zero that can be used to empty rains[i]
                    Integer next = zeros.ceiling(map.get(rains[i])); // return the least element in this set greater than or equal to the given element, or null if there is no such element
                    if (next == null) return new int[0];

                    res[next] = rains[i];
                    zeros.remove(next);
                }
                res[i] = -1;
                map.put(rains[i], i);
            }
        }
        for (int i : zeros) {
            res[i] = 1; // any integer >= 1 and within the days of rains is ok, so we simply choose 1
        }
        return res;
    }
}

```
