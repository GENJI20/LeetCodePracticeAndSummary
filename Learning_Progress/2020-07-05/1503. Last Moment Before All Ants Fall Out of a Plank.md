# 1503. Last Moment Before All Ants Fall Out of a Plank

## Intuition

If two ants bump into each other and change directions, it's the same as if these ants continue as nothing happens.
Then things become easy, we only need to find the left most and right least and compare their move length and pick a bigger one.

```java
class Solution {
    public int getLastMoment(int n, int[] left, int[] right) {
        int max = 0;
        for (int l : left) {
            max = Math.max(l, max);
        }
        for (int r : right) {
            max = Math.max(n - r, max);
        }
        return max;
    }
}
```
