# 162. Find Peak Element

Lets say we have a mid number at index x, `nums[x]`.

if `(num[x+1] > nums[x])`, that means a peak element has to exist on the right half of that array, because (since every number is unique) 1. the numbers keep increasing on the right side, and the peak will be the last element. 2. the numbers stop increasing and there is a 'dip', or there exists somewhere a number such that `nums[y] < nums[y-1]`, which means `number[x]` is a peak element.

This same logic can be applied to the left hand side `nums[x] < nums[x-1]`.

```java
class Solution {
    public int findPeakElement(int[] nums) {
        int l = 0, h = nums.length - 1;
        while (l < h) {
            int mid = l + (h - l) / 2;
            if (nums[mid] > nums[mid + 1]) { // move to left
                h = mid;
            } else if (nums[mid] < nums[mid + 1]) { // move to right
                l = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return l;
    }
}
```
