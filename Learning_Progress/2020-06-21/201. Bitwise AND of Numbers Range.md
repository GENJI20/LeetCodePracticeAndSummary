# Bitwise AND of Numbers Range

* In one word, this problem is asking us to find the common prefix of m and n 's binary code.

```java
[13, 16]

13: 1101
14: 1110
15: 1111
16: 10000

13 & 14 = 1100
1100 & 15 = 1100
1100 & 16 = 1000
```

* so the result should be `1000`, we find exactly the common prefix 1 of 13 and 16 binary code, others should be all equal to 0.

* to get the result, we can cut all these bit that they are different, in this case we cut the right 2 bit first, finallu cut the third right bit.

```java
class Solution {
    public int rangeBitwiseAnd(int m, int n) {
        int i = 0; // how many bits are 0 on the right
        while (m != n) {
            m = m >> 1; // move to right, delete the least significant bit
            n = n >> 1;
            i++;
        }
        return m << i; // move to left, add 0 behind the common prefix
    }
}
```
