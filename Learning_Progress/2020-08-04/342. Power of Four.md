# 342. Power of Four

Math Solution.

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isPowerOfFour(int num) {
        return (Math.log(num) / Math.log(4)) % 1 == 0;
    }
}
```

Recursion. Can be implemented to power of 3, 2 or any other positive numbers.

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isPowerOfFour(int n) {
        if (n > 1) {
            while (n % 4 == 0) {
                n /= 4;
            }
        }
        return n == 1;
    }
}
```

Let's first check if num is a power of two: `x > 0 and x & (x - 1) == 0`.

Then check `(4^n - 1) % 3 == 0`.

(1) 4^n - 1 = (2^n + 1) * (2^n - 1)
(2) among any 3 consecutive numbers, there must be one that is a multiple of 3
among (2^n-1), (2^n), (2^n+1), one of them must be a multiple of 3, and (2^n) cannot be the one, therefore either (2^n-1) or (2^n+1) must be a multiple of 3, and 4^n-1 must be a multiple of 3 as well.

```java
bool isPowerOfFour(int num) {
    return num > 0 && (num & (num - 1)) == 0 && (num - 1) % 3 == 0;
}
```
