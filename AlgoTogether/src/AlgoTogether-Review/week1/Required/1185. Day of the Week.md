# 1185. Day of the Week

## Intuition

Assume we know which day is at 1971-01-01, we can easily calculate days between then conduct the result. But if we don't know that, how can we solve this problem? We need to use exactly today to help us calculate days. **The only difference is the `dayOfWeek` sequence.**

build a `String[]` to store values, since today is 07/02/2020 and it's Thursday, so we use this:

```java
String[] dayOfWeek = new String[] {"Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday"};
```

Then we use a helper fucntion to calculate days.
Becareful with leap year, use `n % 4== 0 && n % 100 != 0 || n % 400 == 0` to identify it.

After we know the number of days between current day and tmp day(input), to get the remainder: `tmpDays - currDays`. If the `remainder < 0`, we use this to fix that: `((tmpDays - currDays) % 7 + 7) % 7`

```java
class Solution {
    public String dayOfTheWeek(int day, int month, int year) {
        int[] dayOfMonth = {31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31};
        // today: Thursday, 2020-07-02
        String[] dayOfWeek = new String[] {"Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday"};
        int currDays = daysSinceStart(2, 7, 2020);
        int tmpDays = daysSinceStart(day, month, year);
        return dayOfWeek[((tmpDays - currDays) % 7 + 7) % 7];
    }

    private int daysSinceStart(int day, int month, int year) {
        int[] dayOfMonth = {31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31};
        int days = 0;
        for (int i = 1971; i < year; i++) {
            days += 365 + isLeapYear(i);
        }

        for (int i = 1; i < month; i++) {
            days += dayOfMonth[i - 1]; // adapt the 0 ~ (n - 1) index
            if (i == 2) {
                days += isLeapYear(year);
            }
        }

        days += day - 1;
        return days;
    }

    private int isLeapYear(int n) {
        if (n % 4 == 0 && n % 100 != 0 || n % 400 == 0) {
            return 1;
        }
        return 0;
    }
}
```

// update on 09/16/2020

keypoint is using current days to calculate the difference between 1971. Be careful with leap year and February.

```java
class Solution {
    public String dayOfTheWeek(int day, int month, int year) {
        // use today 09/16/2020 as Wednesday
        int[] dayOfMonth = {31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31};
        String[] dayOfWeek = new String[] {"Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday", "Monday", "Tuesday"};
        int currDays = daysSinceStart(16, 9, 2020);
        int tmpDays = daysSinceStart(day, month, year);
        return dayOfWeek[((tmpDays - currDays) % 7 + 7) % 7];
    }

    private int daysSinceStart(int day, int month, int year) {
        int days = 0;
        int[] dayOfMonth = {31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31};
        for (int i = 1971; i < year; i++) {
            days += 365 + isLeapYear(i);
        }
        for (int i = 1; i < month; i++) {
            days += dayOfMonth[i - 1];
            if (i == 2) {
                days += isLeapYear(year);
            }
        }
        days += day - 1;
        return days;
    }

    private int isLeapYear(int x) {
        if (x % 4 == 0 && x % 100 != 0 || x % 400 == 0) {
            return 1;
        }
        return 0;
    }
}
```
