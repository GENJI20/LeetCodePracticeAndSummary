# 348. Design Tic-Tac-Toe

## Intuition

track all `n^2` position.

## Improvement

To win this game, the winner must occupy one entire column or row or diagonal or anti-diagonal.

```java
class TicTacToe {

    private int[] rows;
    private int[] cols;
    private int d1;
    private int d2;
    private int n;
    /** Initialize your data structure here. */
    public TicTacToe(int n) {
        rows = new int[n];
        cols = new int[n];
        this.n = n;
    }

    /** Player {player} makes a move at ({row}, {col}).
        @param row The row of the board.
        @param col The column of the board.
        @param player The player, can be either 1 or 2.
        @return The current winning condition, can be either:
                0: No one wins.
                1: Player 1 wins.
                2: Player 2 wins. */
    public int move(int row, int col, int player) {
        int val = (player == 1) ? 1 : -1;
        int target = (player == 1) ? n : -n;

        if (row - col == 0) {
            d1 += val;
            if (d1 == target) {
                return player;
            }
        }

        if (row + col == n - 1) {
            d2 += val;
            if (d2 == target) {
                return player;
            }
        }

        rows[row] += val;
        cols[col] += val;

        if (rows[row] == target || cols[col] == target) {
            return player;
        }
        return 0;
    }
}

/**
 * Your TicTacToe object will be instantiated and called as such:
 * TicTacToe obj = new TicTacToe(n);
 * int param_1 = obj.move(row,col,player);
 */
```
