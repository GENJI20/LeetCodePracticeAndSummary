# 419. Battleships in a Board

## Intuition

Since Battleships can only be placed horizontally or vertically, we just need to go every location, record the count of positions which do not have 'X' in the left or up side, then the count should be the number of battleships.

```java
class Solution {
    public int countBattleships(char[][] board) {
        int m = board.length, n = board[0].length;
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (board[i][j] == '.') continue;
                if (i > 0 && board[i - 1][j] == 'X') continue;
                if (j > 0 && board[i][j - 1] == 'X') continue;
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
