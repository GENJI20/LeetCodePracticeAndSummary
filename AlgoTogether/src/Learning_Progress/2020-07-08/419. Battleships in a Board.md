# 419. Battleships in a Board

## Intuition

Since Battleships can only be placed horizontally or vertically, we just need to go every location, record the count of positions which do not have 'X' in the left or up side, then the count should be the number of battleships.

Going over all cells, we can count only those that are the "first" cell of the battleship. First cell will be defined as the most top-left cell. We can check for first cells by only counting cells that do not have an 'X' to the left and do not have an 'X' above them.

```java
class Solution {
    public int countBattleships(char[][] board) {
        int m = board.length, n = board[0].length;
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (board[i][j] == '.') continue;
                if (i > 0 && board[i - 1][j] == 'X') continue;
                if (j > 0 && board[i][j - 1] == 'X') continue;
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
